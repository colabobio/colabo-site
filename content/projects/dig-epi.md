A participatory simulation platform on infectious diseases. It includes a mobile app that spreads a virtual pathogen over Bluetooth and mirrors epidemiological features of real-world diseases. The outbreak simulation activity allows students to understand principles of disease transmission and mitigation, and the data from the simulations can be visualized with an interactive dashboard for educational and research purposes.

We study the epidemiology of infectious diseases by applying mathematical modeling and computer simulation approaches. We are interested in aggregating heterogeneous data sources, for example, interaction patterns between individuals, clinical symptoms, and population-level variables such as case counts, in order to make riks predictions. We are also developing participatory simulation tools that allow spreading a virual pathogen using smartphones' proximity sensing capabilites and generating synthetic epidemiological datasets that can be used for model validation. These tools have applications in STEM education as well, by supporting experiential outbreak exercises in middle and high schools.

Digital epidemiology, in its broadest definition, is epidemiology that simply uses digital data. More narrowly, it has been defined as "epidemiology that uses digital data collected for non-epidemiological purposes" ([Park et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6230537/); [Salathé, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754279/)). Our current work fits both definitions, but we also envision digital tools such as outbreak simulation games serving a publich health purpose by educating participants through gamification and tracking disease spread by anonyous contact tracing and symptom reporting.

## Operation Outbreak

[Operation Outbreak](https://operationoutbreak.org/) is an app-based participatory simulation platform that spreads a virtual “pathogen” via Bluetooth through peoples' smartphones. The plaform includes other components beyond the smarphone app, including a web admin tool to configure the simulations and an interactive online dashboard to visualize and analyse the resulting data. 

The platform started as an experiential learning exercise at a middle school in Florida, culminating a two-week civics curriculum on public health and outbreak response. The exercise originally used stickers to simulate pathogen transmission, it later on incorporated a Bluetooth-enabled mobile app that increased realism and flexibility.

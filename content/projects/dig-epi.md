Digital epidemiology in its broadest definition is epidemiology that simply uses digital data. More narrowly, it can be defined as "epidemiology that uses digital data collected for non-epidemiological purposes ([Park et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6230537/); [Salath√©, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754279/)). Our [Operation Outbreak project](https://operationoutbreak.org/) would fit either one of these definitions, as it is a participatory simulation platform on infectious diseases that generates digital data representing the ground truth of a simulated outbreak. The platform includes a mobile app that spreads a virtual pathogen over Bluetooth and mirrors epidemiological features of real-world diseases. The outbreak simulation activity allows students to understand principles of disease transmission and mitigation, and the data from the simulations can be visualized with an interactive dashboard for educational and research purposes.

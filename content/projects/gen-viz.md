## Visualization of genomic datasets

New genomic experimental techniques generate not only very large datasets, but also highly dynamic data that changes over time. We aim at creating novel visualization tools that allow to explore these datasets and generate hypothesis of time-based processes, such as regulatory networks and single-cell gene expression data. We are interested in developing new technologies that facilitate interactive exploration as part of larger data analysis pipelines, while based on rigorous statistical foundations to quantify the possibility of false discoveries during this exploration - Tags: #genomic visualization #time-based data #data visualization #interactive false discovery

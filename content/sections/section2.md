## Research

We are currenty focused on epidemiology modeling through participatory simulations with [Operation Outbreak](https://operationoutbreak.org/). OO is a simulation platform that uses smartphones to spread virtual pathogens over Bluetooth and generate synthetic epidemiological data for modeling and STEM education. We also work on the visualization of genomic datasets, clinical ML for emerging infectious diseases, and mobile health with applications in outbreak prevention and risk prediction. Exploration of trans-disciplinary ideas is very important at CoLabo, and we are happy to consider new projects at the intersection of science, art, and education.

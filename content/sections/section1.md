## About CoLabo

The Colubri Laboratory is a “collaboratory”, an open and inclusive space that aims at bringing individuals with different backgrounds and interests. The research in the CoLabo integrates data visualization, machine learning, and mobile technologies to create  innovative tools for biomedical research, education, and outreach. 

We are currenty focused on digital epidemiology through participatory simulations. We are developing [Operation Outbreak](https://operationoutbreak.org/), a simulation platform that uses smartphones to spread virtual pathogens over Bluetooth and to generate synthetic epidemiological data for STEM education and modeling.

## About CoLabo

The Colubri Laboratory is a “collaboratory”, an open and inclusive space that aims at bringing individuals with different backgrounds and interests. The research in the CoLabo integrates data visualization, machine learning, and mobile technologies to create  innovative tools for biomedical research, education, and outreach. 

Currently, a big focus is digital epidemiology through participatory simulations. We are developing [Operation Outbreak](https://operationoutbreak.org/), an infectious disease simulation platform that uses smartphones to spread virtual pathogens over Bluetooth and to generate data for STEM education and epidemiological modeling.
